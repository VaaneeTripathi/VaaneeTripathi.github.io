This project develops a complete system for teaching visual concepts in STEM to visually impaired students through tactile feedback. The system processes video input using OpenCV to extract visual information and translates it into patterns on a refreshable tactile display. The work has been accepted at both the ATIA 2025 Conference and HCII International 2025 with a paper publication. The project focuses on creating hardware prototypes that make abstract computational concepts accessible through dynamic touch-based learning interfaces.
