abstract="Disciplines such as mathematics, computer science, and economics rely heavily on visual representations, creating significant barriers for visually impaired (VI) students in classroom environments. Current assistive technologies are either prohibitively expensive, difficult to implement, or fail to provide immediate tactile feedback during live instruction. This paper introduces a novel tactile display system designed to bridge this accessibility divide through real-time conversion of visual content into tactile feedback.",
