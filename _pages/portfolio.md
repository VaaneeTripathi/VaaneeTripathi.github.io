## Refreshable Tactile Dot Grid
This project develops a complete system for teaching visual concepts in STEM to visually impaired students through tactile feedback. The system processes video input using OpenCV to extract visual information and translates it into patterns on a refreshable tactile display. The work has been accepted at both the ATIA 2025 Conference and HCII International 2025 with a paper publication. The project focuses on creating hardware prototypes that make abstract computational concepts accessible through dynamic touch-based learning interfaces.

## Accessible Intro to CS Curriculum
This independent study develops a comprehensive 5-pronged strategy to improve accessibility in computer science education. The project involved conducting interviews with visually impaired students, professors, and learning support staff to understand real-world challenges in CS education. The work included designing tactile learning kits that translate visual programming concepts into hands-on, multisensory learning experiences. User testing with visually impaired CS students is planned to validate the curriculum's effectiveness followed by deployment to classes with 100+ students every semester.

## The Air Purifier Project
An open-source initiative developing accessible air purification solutions through frugal design principles. The project includes extensive research into air purification mechanisms and fluid dynamics to optimize structural design and airflow patterns. A sensor-based validation system will be integrated to verify filtration efficacy, with emphasis on low-cost materials and efficient construction methods.

## Food Health Monitor (IIT Bombay)
Developed during a 6-week intensive program at IIT Bombay, this project creates a system for early detection of food spoilage. The collaborative effort involved rapid prototyping and iterative design processes to develop innovative food safety monitoring solutions. A provisional patent has been filed for the resulting early warning system technology.

## The Microplasticator
A collaborative project developing systems for measuring microplastic concentrations in liquids using impedance spectroscopy. The three-person team focused on optimizing measurement accuracy, accessibility, and reliability for environmental monitoring applications. The work addresses growing concerns about microplastic contamination in water systems.

## Acoustic Levitation and Holography
An individual research project exploring acoustic levitation and holographic imaging techniques. The work involved understanding complex physics principles, electronics, and custom PCB design while coordinating with international vendors for specialized components. The project required extensive research into wave physics, frequency modulation, and optical interference patterns to achieve stable particle levitation and three-dimensional light projections.

## GenArt
An interdisciplinary project combining projections, performance, and technology to create immersive artistic experiences. The work involved rapid learning of new software systems, hardware research, logistics coordination, and creative concept development within a two-month timeline. The project explores intersections between digital technology and live performance art.
