Hi, I'm Vaanee!

I'm an incoming senior at Ashoka University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Creative Writing. I create technology that's accessible to everyone and enhances people's quality of life. My work focuses on **inclusive design and assistive technology** â€“ because I believe great tech should work for all of us, not just some of us.

Recently, I've been diving deep into **curating accessible educational experiences** for individuals with visual impairments and **creating inclusive digital experiences**. When I'm not coding or researching, you'll find me at the university Makerspace building things with everything from electronics to fabrics. In my spare time, I also write, crochet, and make art.

Interested in collaborating or just want to chat about any of these things? Feel free to reach out!
